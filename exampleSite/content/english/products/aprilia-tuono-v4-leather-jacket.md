Aprilia Motorcycle Racing Jacket is available in different styles/designs with the opportunity to customize it in any way you like. You can match the colors with your ride, write your name/nickname and/or add more branding/logos if you like. If you live in a hot area, you may add perforated leather panels and/or air vents to increase the air flow so you may keep cool while riding. If you like riding in winter, we can add removable quilted lining to trap your body heat for warmth feeling.

The jacket can also be customized to have different speedhumps or not to have it. Speedhumps can be long, short or smart depending on your choice.

We also sell matching trousers, that can be attached to the jacket with a 360 degree zipper in order to make it one piece suite.
